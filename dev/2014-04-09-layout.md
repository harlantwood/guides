Positioning, Layout and Sizing
=======================================

Layout in Famo.us is managed by `Transforms` and `Modifiers`. `Transforms` 
encapsulate the [CSS3 transform specification](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform), that allow for positioning and orienting in 3D space. While a `Transform` is a static object, `Modifiers` encapsulate 
varying `Transforms` over time, as well as bundling convenient layout properties like `size` and `origin` that we will go over below.

Overview
================================================================================

- [Modifiers](#modifiers)
  - [Transforms](#transform)
  - [Size](#size)
  - [Origin](#origin)

<a name="modifiers">Modifiers</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A `Modifier` is a Famo.us node that can be added to the Render Tree. `Modifiers` modify all the nodes below them.
They are defined by holding on to four states: `size`, `transform`, `origin`, and `opacity`. These correspond to the 
hardware accelerated properties that Famo.us can change at 60 FPS.

<a name="transform">Transform</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Transforms` are sixteen-element arrays that correspond directly to a CSS3 transformation matrix. This matrix encodes
a translation, rotation, scale and skew state.

#####Transform.Identity
The default `Transform` is `Transform.identity`, which has no effect on layout. It is like multiplying a number by 1.

The identity transform looks like this:

```js
  [1, 0, 0, 0,
   0, 1, 0, 0,
   0, 0, 1, 0,
   0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#####Transform.translate(x, y, z)
The `.translate` API allows a user to perform a translation in 3D space of the Render Tree below. The translate transform looks like this:

```js
  [1, 0, 0, 0,
   0, 1, 0, 0,
   0, 0, 1, 0,
   x, y, z, 1]
```

#####Transform.Scale(x, y, z)

The `.scale` API allows a user to scale the Render Tree below. The scale transform looks like this:

```js
  [x, 0, 0, 0,
   0, y, 0, 0,
   0, 0, z, 0,
   0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#####Transform.rotateX(radians)
The x-rotation `Transform` results in a clockwise-rotation around the x-axis. It looks like

```js
  [1, 0, 0, 0,
   0, Math.cos(radians), Math.sin(-radians), 0,
   0, Math.sin(radians), Math.cos(radians), 0,
   0, 0 , 0, 1]
```

#####Transform.rotateY(radians)
Similarly, the Y rotation transform looks like this:

```js
  [Math.cos(radians), 0, Math.sin(radians), 0,
   0, 1, 0, 0,
   Math.sin(radians), 0, Math.cos(radians), 0,
   0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#####Transform.rotateZ(radians)
Similarly, the Z rotation transform looks like this:

```js
  [Math.cos(radians), Math.sin(-radians), 0, 0,
   Math.sin(radians), Math.cos(radians), 0, 0,
   0, 0, 1, 0,
   0, 0, 0, 1]
```

#####Transform.multiply(transformA, transformB)

`Transforms` can be composed via the multiplication method, which takes two `Transforms` as arguments. Note: multiplication is not commutative! A translation following by a rotation is not the same as a rotation followed by a translation, for instance.

```js
  Transform.multiply(
    Transform.translate(100,0,0),
    Transform.rotateZ(Math.PI/4)
  );
```

<a name="size">Size</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
`Size` defines a bounding-box for content. Nodes in the Render Tree below sized `Modifiers` can 
use this bounding size to lay themselves out. The simplest example being a `Surface` that takes on the size
of a parenting `Modifier` by setting its own `size` to `undefined`. In the following example, the created
surfaces will have a width of 200, which it inherits from the `Modifier` above it.

```js
  var sizeModifier = new Modifier({size : [200,200]});
  var surface = new Surface({
    size : [undefined, 100], 
    properties : {background : 'red'}
  });
  context.add(sizeModifier).add(surface);
```

Layout views like `GridLayout` and `SequentialLayout` often first take in a sized `Modifier` in order to perform 
layout relative to some size context.

It is often important for these layout widgets to know the size of the nodes they are responsible for positioning.
To do so, Famo.us standardizes on a `.getSize` interface for many of its renderables. For example, a `Scrollview`
will position its content sequentially relative to the height (or width) of the sizes of the renderables it
lays out.

<a name="origin">Origin</a>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Layout is often easily described in terms of 'top left, bottom right, etc'. `Origin` is a way of
defining an arbitrary positioning relative to a `size`.

```js
    var surface = new Surface({
        size: [50, 50],
        properties: {
            background: 'red'
        },
    });

    var originModifier = new Modifier({
        origin: [1, 0.5] // bottom, center
    });

    var sizeModifier = new Modifier({
        size: [100, 100]
    });

    context.add(sizeModifier).add(originModifier).add(surface);
```

In this example, the `surface` will be positioned relative to the bottom-middle of the 100 x 100 area defined by the `sizeModifier`.

To rotate a `Surface` about its center, you will first have to define the origin of the rotation to be about a [.5,.5] origin.

```js
    var surface = new Surface({
        properties: {
            background: 'red'
        },
    });

    var originModifier = new Modifier({
        origin: [0.5, 0.5] // center
    });

    var sizeModifier = new Modifier({
        size: [50, 50]
    });
    
    var rotateModifier = new Modifier({
        transform : Transform.rotateZ(Math.PI/4)
    });

    context.add(sizeModifier).add(originModifier).add(rotateModifier).add(surface);
```
